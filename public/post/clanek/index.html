  <p>Most popular alternate memories
Berenstain Bears or Berenstein Bears – Which do you recall? (Still one of the most popular topics at this website.)</p>

<p>If you’re looking for Mandela Effect examples – or want to verify something you recall – this is a good place to start. These are some (not all) alternate memories that have been discussed at this website.</p>

<p>Bold links will take you to articles at this website, where you can read more. (For more of Fiona’s articles, see the Sitemap.)</p>

<p>Billy Graham’s funeral on TV, prior to his death on 21 Feb 2018 (per NBC News).</p>

<p>Challenger shuttle explosion date? 1984, 1985, or 1986? Winter or another time of year? (Per Wikipedia, it was 28 Jan 1986.) Also, alternate memories about the Columbia.</p>

<p>Colors – Chartreuse and more – Many people recall chartreuse as a pink or reddish color. It’s actually yellow-green.</p>

<p>Curious George – Tail or no tail? (He’s never had a tail.)  This is part of my article about dual memories.</p>

<p>Ghost Hunters TV show — Some remember the earliest show name as TAPS, not Ghost Hunters. (Yes, we know the real-life team is called TAPS, and some of their gear has always said that.)</p>

<p>Henry VIII portrait with a turkey leg in his hand — Many people clearly recall seeing it in history books, but there’s no record of it, now.</p>

<p>Jif or Jiffy Peanut Butter – Jif peanut butter was never called “Jiffy,” in this timestream. (Not confused with Skippy brand, either.)</p>

<p>Lindbergh baby – Never found? In this timestream, the 20-month old baby was found 12 May 1932.</p>

<p>Mother Teresa – A saint before 2016? Several recall her canonization in the 1990s. They also recall her name spelled “Theresa.”</p>

<p>Nelson Mandela’s death in prison, long before his actual death (in this timestream) on 5 December 2013. (This was the alternate memory that launched MandelaEffect.com)</p>

<p>New Zealand’s location, relative to Australia.</p>

<p>Red/blue – Pepsi logo changes, Chevron logo changes, and other color swaps… are they markers, cues, or signs to watch for?</p>

<p>September 22nd or 23rd? – Some people recall events shifting from one of these dates to another.  (The reaction to this article – on- and off-site – has been disproportionate to its apparent minor importance.)</p>

<p>Sky – Changes in the sun, moon, stars, planets and their moons, constellation configurations and placement, and the color of the sky in general.</p>

<p>Tiananmen Square – Memories of a young man being run over by a tank. (Might be Mandela Effect issue or simple media manipulation.).</p>
